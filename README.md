# Keteg
## Kernel Terminal GUI

Simple and lightweight terminal GUI to manage kernels in Manjaro. This works independently of the Manjaro Hardware Detection tool (mhwd)!

_The branch ```mhwd``` contains the same kernel update script but implemented with the system tool mhwd-kernel. You can use either one, whatever you prefer._

---

Usage: You can execute this script like any other shell script. You have two easy ways to do so:

```
$ sh keteg.sh
```
~ OR ~
```
$ chmod +x keteg.sh
$ ./keteg.sh
```
